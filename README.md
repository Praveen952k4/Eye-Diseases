## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing** to assist in the **early detection and classification of eye diseases** from medical reports and patient descriptions.  
The system processes unstructured clinical text, extracts key medical terms, and predicts the likelihood of specific eye conditions, helping healthcare providers make faster, data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the analysis of **ophthalmology-related medical reports**.
- Extract symptoms, medical history, and diagnosis details using NLP.
- Predict possible eye diseases based on extracted features.
- Provide a decision-support tool for doctors and healthcare staff.

---

## 🛠 Learning Experiences
- Built a **text preprocessing pipeline** (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Used **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify medical terms such as disease names, symptoms, and anatomy.
- Trained a **classification model** on annotated medical datasets.
- Implemented **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings** (Word2Vec / BERT) for feature extraction.
- Designed a **user-friendly interface** for uploading reports and viewing predictions.

---

## ⚠ Challenges Faced
- Handling variations in medical terminology and abbreviations.
- Dealing with small, domain-specific datasets.
- Balancing prediction accuracy with interpretability.
- Ensuring compliance with medical data privacy standards.

---

## 📊 Key Takeaways
- Strengthened skills in **medical NLP**, **text classification**, and **entity extraction**.
- Learned how to adapt **transformer-based models** for domain-specific applications.
- Understood the importance of explainable AI in healthcare.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **NLP Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, Transformers (Hugging Face)  
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, BERT  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings  
- **Frameworks:** Flask / Django for deployment  
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for performance metrics

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration with **electronic health record (EHR)** systems.
- Multi-language medical text support.
- Adding **image-based diagnosis** integration from retinal scans.
